I am almost embarrassed to admit that this is the first time in my career that I’ve had my own website. I recently grabbed this `.dev` domain name from GoDaddy after having the same URL with the `.ca` domain for years and never doing much with it.

Now that I’ve got the domain set up, and the site hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (which was unbelievably simple to get setup) I have a couple more tweaks to make before it’s really “launched” IMO. So, I guess right now we’ll say that it’s in soft launched? Or maybe it’s in beta… Although for beta I think that would require people to actually be using the site!

So, in an effort to keep things on track I figured I would start a little running checklist for things I still need to do — instead of waiting until these things are all done to post this site, like the perfectionist in me would rather…

## Todo

- [x]  Create a checklist for tracking todo items (because you always want to cross something off quick!)
- [ ]  Add “uses” page that lists the tech I use, books I enjoy, podcasts I listen to, etc.
- [ ]  Add “tags” for blog posts with a “word cloud” of popular tags, sorted by how often I’ve used them.
- [ ]  Write a “how I built this blog” post.
- [ ]  Setup a me@patrickkellar.dev email address
- [ ]  Setup “contact me” page
- [ ]  Setup a “subscribe” form for signing up to receive email notifications about new posts
- [ ]  Add common article signature instead of adding it to each post (This one will come in handy)

That’s all for today,

Patrick ✌️
