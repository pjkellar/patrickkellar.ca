import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/ArticleLayout'

export const meta = {
  author: 'Patrick Kellar',
  date: '2022-12-29',
  title: 'My first article',
  description:
    'The obligatory first article explaining why I created a blog!',
}

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

Obviously when you start a blog you need to write the first "why I started this blog" post. This is that post.

```bash

echo 'whytho?'

```
