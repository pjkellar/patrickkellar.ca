From what I’ve gathered in reading other people’s blogs is that when you create a blog, you ****must**** make your first post about “why” you are creating said blog…

## So why am I doing this?

I’ve been listening to [Caleb Porzio’s](https://twitter.com/calebporzio) “Notes on Work” podcast more frequently recently and it’s a point that he seems to touch on often —

> When you are stuck on a problem, try writing about that problem. Write something that details what you are trying to do, what you have already tried, and why you *****think***** the problem is happening.
> 

 Often times, you can sort out your own issues when you write them down — the right path almost jumps out at you when you see it written down long-form.

This idea resonated with me, and since I am not about to start recording myself talking about my problems out loud (not yet anyway…) I figured this would be a good alternative.

## Public post-it note

I used to be the type of developer that scattered post-its all over their desk with all the things I had to do in a day. I’ve iterated on that design many times over the years, but I always come back to something that resembles that pattern. My current system is a combination of Todoist and Notion — if you follow any of the “Productivity YouTuber’s” this won’t be new for you. Why am I saying this? Well initially I plan on using this platform as a way to make my digital “post-its” more visible. My hope is that with them being more visible it will help me to refine them a little better and in turn, that will help me to refine my processes.

So, if any of this sounds interesting — and I know right now it’s nothing new or exciting — please follow along as I begin this blogging journey in 2023. If you have comments or questions, or just want to reach out, check out my [social links](https://patrickkellar.dev/about) or email me.
